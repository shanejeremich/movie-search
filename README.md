# UX Developer Intern & Web Developer Intern Challenge - Fall 2021

The Shoppies: Movie awards for entrepreneurs

Shopify has branched out into movie award shows and we need your help. Please build us an app to help manage our movie nominations for the upcoming Shoppies.

The Challenge

We need a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

This is a submission for the following challenge: [Google Docs link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AZO0BZwn1Aogj4f3PDNe1mhq8pKsXZxtrG--EIbP_-w/edit#)
